# space-invaders
 
 Based off Techwithtim's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM (got assets from there and followed along a bit)

Workflow: 
1) Setup classes for each object (each ship and invader)
2) Give each class functions for their "abilities" aka shooting and moving
3) Define a main where everything interacts (the actual game)
4) Provide a main menu
